# ESP32 Pressure Sensor Project

### Project Overview
The ESP32 Pressure Sensor project illustrates how to measure analog values from a pressure sensor using an ESP32 microcontroller. Pressure sensors are crucial in various applications such as weather monitoring, industrial automation, and robotics for precise measurement of pressure changes.

### Components Needed
- **ESP32 Microcontroller**: Controls and processes analog data from the sensor.
- **Pressure Sensor**: Measures pressure variations and converts them into electrical signals.
- **Jumper Wires**: Connect the pressure sensor to the ESP32.
- **Breadboard**: Optional, for organizing the circuit connections.

### Block diagram

### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Pressure Sensor to ESP32:**
   - **Analog Input (pressurePin)**: Connect the analog output of the pressure sensor to GPIO 34 on the ESP32.
   - **Power Supply**: Ensure the pressure sensor is supplied with the appropriate voltage (e.g., 3.3V or 5V) and GND.

### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize serial communication using `Serial.begin(9600)` for debugging purposes.
   - Define the GPIO pin connected to the pressure sensor (`pressurePin` set to 34).

2. **Operation:**
   - **Reading Pressure Data:**
     - Use `analogRead(pressurePin)` to capture the analog signal from the pressure sensor.
     - Print the obtained value to the Serial Monitor using `Serial.print` and `Serial.println`.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Calibration:** Calibrate the pressure sensor if precise pressure readings are required.
   - **Data Interpretation:** Understand the sensor's output range and scale accordingly for accurate pressure measurement.

### Applications
- **Weather Monitoring:** Measure atmospheric pressure changes for weather forecasting.
- **Industrial Automation:** Monitor pressure levels in pneumatic systems and machinery.
- **Robotics:** Implement pressure sensors for feedback control in robotic grippers and actuators.
